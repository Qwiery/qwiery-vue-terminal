# Vue Terminal Component

Install with `npm install @orbifold/vue-terminal --save`

## Some internals

The terminal consists of three visual parts:

- the optional banner: only shown at the start of a session
- the output: the part above the input growing with each interaction. The output can be of three types:
  - output coming some processing
  - the input given being repeated (before showing the process output)
  - an error/warning/info: looks different from the other two in order to draw attention
- the input: where you type stuff, but if you use u/down arrows there is also input coming from the terminal itself. Auto-completion would be another case.

The terminal accept various input types and accodingly there are different types of 'messages' handed over to processing. The simplest case is text but you could also drag-drop and image.
The terminal receives various types of events from the controller:

- **input**: something changing the input line (autocomplete, history navigation...)
- **output**: something to be shown in the output stack
- **command**: not anything visual, but an instruction to do something on the UI level (e.g. clear the terminal).

The component tries hard to makes sense of input and output, to render things appropriately and make it flexible for various use cases. For example, a custom command needs to return a `CommandMessage` but if a string or a different message type is returned (by the custom function) it will be handled nevertheless.

## Messages

## How to handle input?

Hook up the `executor` property

```html
<template>
<Terminal :executor="executor" />
</templare>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { TextMessage} from "@orbifold/entities";
function executor(input: Message) {
	 if (input instanceof TextMessage) {
    return"you said " + input.text;
  }
}
</script>
```
The reason why the `input` parameter is not a simple string is because the terminal can handle code snippets, images, whatnot. If you are only interested in dealing with simple textual input (say a bot), you can simply use the `TextMessage` for everything. 

The function can be `async` if necessary. Internally the return is converted to a `TextMessage` if a string is given. If you change the function to the following, the result will be eactly the same:

```TypeScript
import { TextMessage} from "@orbifold/entities";
function executor(input: Message) {
	 if (input instanceof TextMessage) {
    return TextMessage.fromString("you said " + input.text);
  }
}
```

Returning messages rather than a string does give more flexibility. For example, a message can have annotations, these are arbitrary indications and, for instance, the `color` key will tell the renderer to display the text in purple:

```TypeScript
import * from '@orbifold/entities';
function executor(input:string){
  const message = TextMessage.fromString("You gave: " + input);
  message.annotations ={
    color: "purple"
  }
 return message;
}
```

If you wish to return an error (rendered by default in red):

```TypeScript
import * from '@orbifold/entities';
function executor(input:string){
 return ErrorMessage.fromString("This isn't right ðŸ«¤")
}
```

## How handle commands?

## How to define an alias?

An alias or redirect will convert some string input to something else. For instance, the command `clear` will clear the terminal but this is an alias for `!clear` since commands should normally be prefixed with `!`.
